## Creating a Table Using SQL
## Database Design
- Designed and created a database named InsuranceDB to manage patient, provider, treatment, and insurance information efficiently.
- Defined core tables: Patient, Provider, Treatment, and Insurance.
## Relationship Management
- Established relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys for data integrity.
- Designed a Transactable table to map the many-to-many relationships among patients, providers, and treatments.
## Data Population
- Inserted sample data into all tables, simulating real-world healthcare scenarios.
- Added age validation constraints to the Patient table to ensure data accuracy.
## Data Retrieval
- Developed complex SQL queries using joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER, CROSS) to retrieve and combine data across multiple tables.
- Queried specific use cases, such as retrieving patient insurance details and identifying patients treated for specific conditions by particular providers.
## Data Optimization
- Created non-clustered indexes on frequently used columns like FirstName, ProviderName, and TreatmentName to optimize query performance.
## Insurance Data Management
- Designed an Insurance table to manage patient insurance policies, including details such as policy number, insurance name, and coverage type.
- Populated the table with sample insurance policies linked to respective patients.
## Reporting and Analytics
- Built queries to extract detailed reports, integrating data across patients, providers, treatments, and insurance policies.
- Enabled insights into healthcare operations through structured reporting.
## Documentation
- Documented all steps of the project, including database design, data manipulation, and query development, for clarity and reproducibility.
